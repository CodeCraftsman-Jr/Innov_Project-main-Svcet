📢 SVCET R&D Project – Physiotherapy Dept.
Hello everyone! 👋
I’m a B.Tech student from Sri Venkateshwaraa College of Engineering, Pondicherry (SVCET), and I’ve made this project public to help fellow students and researchers understand the kind of initiatives happening in our college — especially those who are searching for similar academic projects.

📌 About the Project
This is an early-stage project developed under the R&D Cell of SVCET for the Physiotherapy Department. It includes basic test files that demonstrate the core structure and initial working of the system.

⚠️ Note:
These files are for demonstration purposes only and do not include the actual source files, which remain confidential due to institutional policies.
However, this repo can give you a fair idea of how the system is being designed and implemented.

📬 Want the original source files?
